linux使用qemu磁盘没有权限
<!--more-->

报错内容
```bash
cannot access storage file (as uid:107, gid:107)  permission denied
```

修改方法
/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
```bash
# user = "qemu" # A user named "qemu"
# user = "+0" # Super user (uid=0)
# user = "100" # A user named "100" or a user with uid=100
#
user = "root"
# The group for QEMU processes run by the system instance. It can be
# specified in a similar way to user.
group = "root"
```
