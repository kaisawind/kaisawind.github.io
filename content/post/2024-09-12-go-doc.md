## 1. 包注释

```go
// Package path implements utility routines for manipulating slash-separated
// paths.
//
// The path package should only be used for paths separated by forward
// slashes, such as the paths in URLs. This package does not deal with
// Windows paths with drive letters or backslashes; to manipulate
// operating system paths, use the [path/filepath] package.
package path
```

## 2. 命令注释

```go
/*
Gofmt formats Go programs.
It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment.
Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file,
it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in
that directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.)
By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file's formatting is different than gofmt's, print diffs
        to standard output.
    -w
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file's formatting is different from gofmt's, overwrite it
        with gofmt's version. If an error occurred during overwriting,
        the original file is restored from an automatic backup.

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program
or a program fragment. A program fragment must be a syntactically
valid declaration list, statement list, or expression. When formatting
such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading
and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be
formatted by piping them through gofmt.

## 3. 标题

```go
// Package strconv implements conversions to and from string representations
// of basic data types.
//
// # Numeric Conversions
//
// The most common numeric conversions are [Atoi] (string to int) and [Itoa] (int to string).
package strconv

// #This is not a heading, because there is no space.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// # because it is multiple lines.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// because it is also multiple lines.
//
// The next paragraph is not a heading, because there is no additional text:
//
// #
//
// In the middle of a span of non-blank lines,
// # this is not a heading either.
//
//     # This is not a heading, because it is indented.

// Package json implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in
// [RFC 7159]. The mapping between JSON and Go values is described
// in the documentation for the Marshal and Unmarshal functions.
//
// For an introduction to this package, see the article
// “[JSON and Go].”

## 5. 文档链接

```go
package bytes

// ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing
// the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read. Any
// error except [io.EOF] encountered during the read is also returned. If the
// buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with [ErrTooLarge].
func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error) {
    ...
}
```

## 6. 列表

1. 无序列表

```go
package url

// PublicSuffixList provides the public suffix of a domain. For example:
//   - the public suffix of "example.com" is "com",
//   - the public suffix of "foo1.foo2.foo3.co.uk" is "co.uk", and
//   - the public suffix of "bar.pvt.k12.ma.us" is "pvt.k12.ma.us".
//
// Implementations of PublicSuffixList must be safe for concurrent use by
// multiple goroutines.
//
// An implementation that always returns "" is valid and may be useful for
// testing but it is not secure: it means that the HTTP server for foo.com can
// set a cookie for bar.com.
//
// A public suffix list implementation is in the package
// golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix.
type PublicSuffixList interface {
    ...
}
```

2. 有序列表

```go
package path

// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
// by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules
// iteratively until no further processing can be done:
//
//  1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
//  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
//  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
//     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
//  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
//     that is, replace "/.." by "/" at the beginning of a path.
//
// The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root "/".
//
// If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
// returns the string ".".
//
// See also Rob Pike, “[Lexical File Names in Plan 9].”
//
// [Lexical File Names in Plan 9]: https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html
func Clean(path string) string {
    ...
}
```

## 7. 代码块

```go
package sort

// Search uses binary search...
//
// As a more whimsical example, this program guesses your number:
//
//  func GuessingGame() {
//      var s string
//      fmt.Printf("Pick an integer from 0 to 100.\n")
//      answer := sort.Search(100, func(i int) bool {
//          fmt.Printf("Is your number <= %d? ", i)
//          fmt.Scanf("%s", &s)
//          return s != "" && s[0] == 'y'
//      })
//      fmt.Printf("Your number is %d.\n", answer)
//  }
func Search(n int, f func(int) bool) int {
    ...
}
```

```go
package path

// Match reports whether name matches the shell pattern.
// The pattern syntax is:
//
//  pattern:
//      { term }
//  term:
//      '*'         matches any sequence of non-/ characters
//      '?'         matches any single non-/ character
//      '[' [ '^' ] { character-range } ']'
//                  character class (must be non-empty)
//      c           matches character c (c != '*', '?', '\\', '[')
//      '\\' c      matches character c
//
//  character-range:
//      c           matches character c (c != '\\', '-', ']')
//      '\\' c      matches character c
//      lo '-' hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi
//
// Match requires pattern to match all of name, not just a substring.
// The only possible returned error is [ErrBadPattern], when pattern
// is malformed.
func Match(pattern, name string) (matched bool, err error) {
    ...
}
