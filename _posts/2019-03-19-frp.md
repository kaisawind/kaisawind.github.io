frp 是一个可用于内网穿透的高性能的反向代理应用，支持 tcp, udp 协议，为 http 和 https 应用协议提供了额外的能力，且尝试性支持了点对点穿透。
<!--more-->

### 1. 架构

![frp](/assets/img/frp_architecture.png)

### 2. 代理结构

frps部署在服务端(局域网1)，并能够对外网暴露端口。frpc部署在客户端(局域网2)，但是不能对外暴露端口。

为了让局域网1能够访问局域网2的内部服务，所以需要将局域网2的服务代理到局域网1。这样，局域网1就像访问内网的一样访问局域网2。

代理成功之后，也可以将代理的端口在局域网1暴露到公网上，使得，公网能够访问局域网2。

### 3. 前提条件

1. frps服务端必须能够暴露公网端口。
2. frpc能够连接外网。

### 4. 配置

frpc.service

```conf
[Unit]
Description=frp: frp is a fast reverse proxy to help you expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet. As of now, it supports tcp & udp, as well as http and https protocols, where requests can be forwarded to internal services by domain name.
Documentation=https://github.com/fatedier/frp
